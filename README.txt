// Overview
Lebenswelt v.2 is a WordPress codebase developed by @FiatInsight. It builds substantially on its predecessors, and incoporates a large knowledge base to leverage common development scenarios for rapidly prototyping and deploying custom client site builds.

// Structure
The codebase is broken down into substantial elements based on functional context within WordPress. Three files control the basic page layout and general schematic: header.php, page-layout.php, and footer.php. Subfiles call to separate scripts and layouts, grouped by lowest common feature vis-Ã -vis rapid, flexible development.
